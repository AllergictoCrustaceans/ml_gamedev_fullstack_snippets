# ML & DS, Game Development, and Full Stack Javascript Snippets #

One-stop shop of code snippets to showcase my coding skills throughout the years. 

I started coding in 2018, but haven't created a 'coding timeline' yet to track it all on Github. This is me starting one. In 2023. 
I've explored different software engieering avenues throughout the years, and this repo upholds the notion that I'm still fond of practicing them all (full stack, ML, game development).

Why all 3... why not just pick 1? 
I don't want to throw all that I've learned down the drain. Software engineering is hard! If I learned it, I'm maintaining my knowledge of it.

### What's in this Repo? ###
- full_stack/
- machine_learning/
- game_dev/

Each of these folders hold snippets of code from coursework, or larger private repositories that I am allowed to share publicly. 

### Why Not Link the Project Repo Itself?
Most of the projects that I regularly push to are private repositories, or they are Google Colab Notebooks, so I can't showcase them as conveniently as I want to. 

Also, pushing snippets in here is my way of raising my hand and saying, "Hey-- you won't see any green dots on my Github, and that's b/c I've moved to Bitbucket. Check out what I've been up to from here."
