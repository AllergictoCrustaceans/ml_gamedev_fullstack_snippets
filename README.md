# README #

One-stop shop of code snippets to showcase my coding skills throughout the years. 

I started coding in 2018, but haven't created a 'coding timeline' yet to track it all. This is me starting one. In 2023. 

### What's in this Repo? ###
- full_stack/
- machine_learning/
- game_dev/

Each of these folders hold snippets of code from coursework, or larger private repositories that I am allowed to share publicly. 

### Why Do Snippets of Code and Not Link the Project Repo?
Most of the projects that I regularly push to are private repositories, or they are Jupyter or Google Colab Notebooks, so I can't showcase them as conveniently as I want to. 

Also, pushing snippets in here is my way of raising my hand and saying, "Hey-- you won't see any green dots on my Github, and that's b/c I've moved to Bitbucket. Check out what I've been up to from here."
