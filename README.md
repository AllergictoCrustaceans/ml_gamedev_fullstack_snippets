# ML & DS, Game Development, and Full Stack Javascript Snippets #

This is a compilation of code snippets showcasing my coding skills throughout the years in the realm of full-stack, game development, and machine learning. 

I started coding in 2018, but haven't created a 'coding timeline' yet to track it all on Github. This is me starting one. In 2023. 

Why not just pick 1 sofware engineering field to focus on? 
I don't want to throw all that I've learned down the drain. Software engineering is hard! If I learned it, I'm maintaining my knowledge of it.

### What's in this Repo? ###
- full_stack/
- machine_learning/
- game_dev/

Each of these folders hold snippets of code from coursework, or larger private repositories that I am allowed to share publicly. 

### Why Not Link the Project Repo Itself?
Most of the projects that I regularly push to are private repositories, or they are Google Colab Notebooks, so I can't showcase them as conveniently as I want to.
